Many of you are probably familiar with the game Guess Who. For this activity, you will play a slightly modified version of it.

You will have to guess the animal the computer has picked by asking YES/NO questions.

Be aware that some animals can appear multiple times, and you may group several different animals together in one question. For example, you may group eagles and frogs together to ask "Is it an eagle or a frog?"



Play a few rounds on the game below try to get to the answer as fast as you can!


After you are done, estimate the average number of YES/NO questions needed to find the animal, assuming you ask optimally.
(Hint: consider animal occurrence.)
